## Background Information

In fantasy football, each player has a projected score for their upcoming game. It is not uncommon for a player to have a high projected score only to actually produce a score below projection. On the flip side, it is not uncommon for a player to have a low projected score only to actually produce a score above projection. We are pursuing this project to see what influences a player's actual output score the most so that we can make data based decisions when building a team or starting lineup week to week during the NFL season. We plan on using 2019 and 2020 NFL season data for this project.

## Machine Learning

We intend to use a classification model with a 70/30 train/test split to determine whether or not a player will perform above or below the projected fantasy points. Critical to this model is engineering binary features to complement the numeric features we have found, and fine-tuning parameters to make the model account for complexities in the selected features, but flexible enough to take in 2021 fantasy projections and help fantasy managers to decide who to draft, start, trade for, and pick up off of the waiver wire.

Our intent is to deploy our trained model to a web application that requests basic user input and takes certain features into account to provide a prediction (which could be taken as a recommendation) about a playerâ€™s performance in the coming week.
